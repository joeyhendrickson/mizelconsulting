    "description": "This complete OSHA 40-Hour Hazwoper Training is developed for, and should be taken by those workers and employees who could be exposed to hazardous substances and hazardous materials at the workplace. There are many different forms of workplace HazMat exposure to workers safety and health, but some include clean-up operations, the disposal, treatment, or storage of hazardous substances, emergency response, or hazardous waste operations involving wastes at facilities. This training course, which is taken entirely online, has been built to adhere specifically to the OSHA Hazwoper training requirements standard 29 CFR 1910.120, and is regularly reviewed for optimum content quality and complete accuracy to adhere to all OSHA regulations.\n\nAlong with any Hazwoper 40 Hour training, the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) asks (per 29 CFR 1910.120 (e)(3)(i)) that employees or workers also receive 3 days of work site specific training from their employer, under the guidance of an experienced supervisor. Every employer workplace requirement is different, and brings with it its own unique hazards and protective equipment required for workers. That’s why OSHA has the requirement for HAZWOPER Certification, that, in addition to any 40 hour hazwoper training, you thoroughly cover the specific hazards, and hazardous substances defined by OSHA, that are present on the job site, with the employer or supervisor at that work site.\n\nOur HAZWOPER training includes hazard identification, remediation and prevention methods, and the initial training is made up of 10 modules that cover a variety of topics within the regulations set by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.120.e such as hazardous substances, materials, personal protective equipment and many others.",
